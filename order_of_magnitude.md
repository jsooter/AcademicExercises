## Order of Magnitude "Big O"

Big O notation is written in the form of O(n) where O stands for “order of magnitude” and n represents what 
we’re comparing the complexity of a task against.


Constant Complexity: O(1)
----
    A constant task’s run time won’t change no matter what the input value is. 

Linear Complexity: O(n)
----
    A linear task’s run time will vary depending on it’s input value.
